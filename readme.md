# Tu Casa VR
One of the principal purposes of virtual reality (VR) is exploring environments which are hard to access (or just impossible). With this application I envisioned the ability to delve into an architectonic setting which we can personalize to increase the likelihood of selling a property to a client.
## Objectives

 - Explore the 3D model of a house/apartment with VR visors
 - Customize the interiors (i.e. furniture) and exteriors (i.e. house materials) to the liking of a potential client.
 - Create the 3D models and have a mechanism to download them without hard-coding them directly into the app.
## Demo
Here is a demo of the app, available in **Youtube**:
